# change log:
- Fix error message when improper location is entered in full query string
- Change query string parameter for date filtering

# todo:
- migrate to new versions of react, react-dom, react-form, react-number-format


# notes:
- check to see if withTracker is being used correctly: https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/react-meteor-data
- loading spinner appears to stall the app occasionally when using chrome? might just be my particular user agent, it really does not like spinners
