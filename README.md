- d3:
	- better tooltips
	- force / "jittering" to un-stack entries with same time/date
	- make x axis work with time better (since 60 min in hour...)

- responsiveness
	- hold window size in redux state?

- form validation for:
	- other railroads
	- other railroads' symbols

- mobile form datetime
	- react-datetime looks promising
	- separate datetime input for mobile - https://goshakkk.name/different-mobile-desktop-tablet-layouts-react/

- sharing url of search results to others:
	- https://guide.meteor.com/data-loading.html#changing-arguments
	- or, a share button that generates url with params in, and give component logic to try to parse these on load

- loading spinner
