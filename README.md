# change log:
- add query navigation accordions
- media queries to size forms and tables

# todo:
- if a bad city or state is entered with a good railroad and symbol, "bad railroad" error shows
- migrate to new versions of react, react-dom, react-form, react-number-format


# notes:
- check to see if withTracker is being used correctly: https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/react-meteor-data
- loading spinner appears to stall the app occasionally when using chrome? might just be my particular user agent, it really does not like spinners
