# change log:
- Split location form field into separate city and state

# todo:
- make sure empty location (with just spaces or other chars that will be stripped out) cannot be submitted
- after comment submit, clear out textarea and maybe try to close panel?

# notes:
- Check to see if withTracker is being used correctly: https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/react-meteor-data
- Loading spinner appears to stall the app occasionally when using chrome? might just be my particular user agent, it really does not like spinners
